      Note the use of %PUB_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` directory during the build process.
      Only files within the `public` directory can be linked from this HTML file.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUB_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      function correctly with both client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by executing `npm run build`.
